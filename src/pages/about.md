# Hi, I'm Vinay 👋

**DevOps & Platform Engineer** with **5+ years of experience** building secure, scalable AI platforms in cloud-native environments.

---

## Current Role

**DevOps Lead** at a stealth AI startup, where I'm responsible for:

- **LLM Infrastructure** — Deployed and scaled production LLM workloads on Kubernetes using **vLLM**, **TensorRT-LLM**, and **SGLang**
- **Performance Optimization** — Eliminated infrastructure bottlenecks (PVC latency, RDMA, and network issues) to significantly improve inference performance
- **Observability** — Built end-to-end observability stacks using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Loki**, and **OpenTelemetry** to monitor and auto-scale workloads
- **CI/CD** — Streamlined pipelines to deliver reliable, secure deployments at scale

## Previous Experience

**Security Engineer → DevSecOps Lead** at Predera Technologies

- Hardened cloud infrastructure with **NIST CSF** and **CIS** benchmarks
- Designed and migrated workloads to private **GKE** clusters with VPN access
- Shipped multi-region, zero-downtime LLM deployments with **TLS/mTLS** security
- Built an internal SOC using **Security Onion** (SIEM + IDS + log management)

## What Drives Me

I'm fascinated by systems thinking — understanding how software and hardware come together to solve real problems. My goal is to build platforms that automate the tedious, scale the complex, and ultimately make life simpler for the people who use them.
