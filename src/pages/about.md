Hi, I'm **Vinay**, a DevOps Engineer with 4+ years of experience building
secure, scalable cloud-native platforms.

I specialize in:
- Kubernetes & Cloud Infrastructure
- LLM inference platforms (vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, SGLang)
- CI/CD & automation
- Performance benchmarking & scaling

I love building systems that are reliable, fast, and secure.
