Showcase Real Skills\\n\\nTraditional resumes list technologies you\'ve used, but a portfolio demonstrates **how** you use them. When you deploy a website using GitHub Actions, configure Kubernetes clusters, or optimize LLM inference pipelines, you\'re showing potential employers exactly what you can do.\\n\\n### 2. Document Your Learning Journey\\n\\nA blog helps you:\\n- Solidify your understanding of complex topics\\n- Create a reference for your future self\\n- Help others who face similar challenges\\n\\n### 3. Stand Out in the Job Market\\n\\nMost engineers have similar resumes. A well-maintained portfolio with technical blogs sets you apart. It shows:\\n- Initiative and self-motivation\\n- Communication skills\\n- Passion for the craft\\n\\n### 4. Build Your Personal Brand\\n\\nYour portfolio becomes your professional identity online. Whether it\'s LLM infrastructure, Kubernetes, or DevSecOps, your content establishes you as someone who knows their domain.\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nI\'ll be sharing deep dives into:\\n- **LLM Infrastructure**: vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, SGLang deployments\\n- **Kubernetes**: Production-grade cluster management\\n- **DevSecOps**: Security-first CI/CD pipelines\\n- **Cloud-Native**: Scalable, resilient architectures\\n\\nStay tuned!"}]}}')}}]);
