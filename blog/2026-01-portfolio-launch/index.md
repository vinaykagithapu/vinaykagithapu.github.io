A resume shows **what** you did.
A portfolio shows **how well** you did it.

## Why Build a Portfolio?

In this post, I explain why every DevOps engineer should maintain a public portfolio and blog.

### 1. Showcase Real Skills

Traditional resumes list technologies you've used, but a portfolio demonstrates **how** you use them. When you deploy a website using GitHub Actions, configure Kubernetes clusters, or optimize LLM inference pipelines, you're showing potential employers exactly what you can do.

### 2. Document Your Learning Journey

A blog helps you:
- Solidify your understanding of complex topics
- Create a reference for your future self
- Help others who face similar challenges

### 3. Stand Out in the Job Market

Most engineers have similar resumes. A well-maintained portfolio with technical blogs sets you apart. It shows:
- Initiative and self-motivation
- Communication skills
- Passion for the craft

### 4. Build Your Personal Brand

Your portfolio becomes your professional identity online. Whether it's LLM infrastructure, Kubernetes, or DevSecOps, your content establishes you as someone who knows their domain.

## What's Next?

I'll be sharing deep dives into:
- **LLM Infrastructure**: vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, SGLang deployments
- **Kubernetes**: Production-grade cluster management
- **DevSecOps**: Security-first CI/CD pipelines
- **Cloud-Native**: Scalable, resilient architectures

Stay tuned!
