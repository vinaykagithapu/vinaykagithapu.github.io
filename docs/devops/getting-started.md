# Getting Started with DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently.

## Core DevOps Principles

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)
Developers regularly merge code changes into a central repository, followed by automated builds and tests.

### 2. Continuous Delivery (CD)
Code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release to production.

### 3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Managing infrastructure through code rather than manual processes.

### 4. Monitoring & Logging
Continuously monitoring metrics and logs to understand application and infrastructure health.

### 5. Collaboration
Breaking down silos between development and operations teams.
