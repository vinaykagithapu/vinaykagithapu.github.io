# Getting Started with Security

Security is a critical aspect of building and maintaining modern cloud-native applications. This section covers security fundamentals and best practices for protecting your infrastructure and applications.

## Security Pillars

### 1. Identity & Access Management (IAM)
Control who can access what resources and what actions they can perform.

- Principle of least privilege
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

### 2. Network Security
Protect your network infrastructure and control traffic flow.

- Network segmentation
- Firewalls and security groups
- Zero-trust networking

### 3. Data Security
Protect data at rest and in transit.

- Encryption (TLS, AES)
- Key management
- Data classification

### 4. Application Security
Secure your applications from vulnerabilities.

- Input validation
- Authentication & authorization
- Secure coding practices

### 5. Infrastructure Security
Harden your infrastructure components.

- Host hardening
- Container security
- Kubernetes security

## Security Frameworks
