# Getting Started with MLOps

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices that combines Machine Learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering to deploy and maintain ML systems in production reliably and efficiently.

## What is MLOps?

MLOps bridges the gap between ML model development and operations, enabling:

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery** for ML models
- **Model versioning** and experiment tracking
- **Automated training** pipelines
- **Model monitoring** and drift detection
- **Scalable inference** infrastructure

## Key Components

### 1. Data Pipeline
Managing data collection, validation, and preprocessing in a reproducible manner.

### 2. Model Training
Automating model training with experiment tracking and hyperparameter optimization.

### 3. Model Registry
Version control for ML models with metadata tracking.

### 4. Model Serving
Deploying models for inference with proper scaling and monitoring.

### 5. Monitoring
Tracking model performance, data drift, and system health.

## Coming Soon

Stay tuned for detailed tutorials on:
- Setting up ML pipelines with Kubeflow
- LLM inference with vLLM and TensorRT-LLM
- Model serving on Kubernetes
- Experiment tracking with MLflow
